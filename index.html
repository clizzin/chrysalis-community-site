    <h1>Chrysalis Community</h1>
    <p>
      Chrysalis is an intentional community house in Berkeley, California, on
      the ancestral lands of the Chochenyo Ohlone people. In addition to living
      together, we try to hold space for our wider community, share resources,
      and organize collective action.
