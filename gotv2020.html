      This flyer was created to convert voters who've already voted into volunteers. The content was
      a collaboration between Igor from Chrysalis and Anna Maria and Autumn with 30Friends. The rest
      of Chrysalis provided lots of content feedback.

      The final design was created by <a href="https://www.upwork.com/fl/mikecibene">Mike Cibene</a>,
      who also provided the Spanish-language translation.
